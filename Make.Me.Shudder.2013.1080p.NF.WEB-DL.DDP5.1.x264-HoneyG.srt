1
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,600
Hey. We're here.

2
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,560
Hurry up, you guys.

3
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,520
Here it is. The red-stair house.

4
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,520
Are the two of you...

5
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,440
coming in with us?

6
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,560
I don't think so.

7
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,960
Look at the atmosphere. Super spooky.

8
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,400
What are you scared of?

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,280
I've been to this house before.

10
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,040
There's nothing.

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,600
-What about you?
-I'm not going in. You're going in, Oil?

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,920
-I better not go in.
-Chicken.

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,880
I'm recording this as evidence.

14
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,680
-What the fuck are you recording, Biew?
-You two.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,280
You're not going in?

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,960
Then I'll go.

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,040
-Nick, wait for me.
-Hurry up then.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,480
You'll see. Come on.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
-Hey. Wait for me.
-Hurry up.

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,680
-Is this for real?
-Yeah. This is for real.

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,520
-It's so desolate here.
-You're right.

22
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,920
Damn. How can it be this creepy?

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,120
-Wait, Nick!
-What?

24
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,040
-Tell me if you see something.
-Sure.

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,560
I'll let you know.

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,680
Can you just keep it down?

27
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,040
It's so fucking eerie in here.

28
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,080
Here it is. The red-stairs.

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,840
They really are red.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,600
Curious about its history?

31
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,560
This place's history...

32
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,400
Ready?

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,440
-You really want to hear it?
-No.

34
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,280
The owners of the house
fought over something,

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,440
and fell down!

36
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,320
Brains everywhere.

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Brains everywhere?

38
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,160
Super terrifying.

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,400
Shit! You scared me.

40
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,680
-Get that flashlight out of your face.
-Come on. Hurry.

41
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,360
I said don't be afraid.
If I see a ghost, I'll beat it up.

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,240
-What a bruiser.
-That's not all.

43
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,480
That's not all?

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,160
Every year, people would come
and hang themselves here.

45
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,160
You better be careful if you're slow.

46
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,600
What the hell is wrong with you?

47
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,400
Shit!

48
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,880
-Should we go in?
-I say we go back.

49
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,080
Hey. They're your friends.

50
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,160
Let's go take a look.

51
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,400
The second floor is creepier
than the first floor. Shit.

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,240
-Stop!
-It's here!

53
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,600
-It's a ghost?
-Ghost my ass.

54
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,520
I think it's in this room
that people hanged themselves.

55
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,400
Follow me, and watch your steps.

56
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
Slip and your brains would splash.

57
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,160
Let's go.

58
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,160
Let's go back.

59
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,000
It's probably nothing.

60
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,680
-It's all in your head.
-It's not in my damn head!

61
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,480
I know you heard it too,
or else you wouldn't turn around.

62
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,720
Come on. Follow me.

63
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,080
Turn on the flashlight.

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,600
Which way?

65
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,720
-I think it's this way.
-I heard it from this way.

66
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,320
Hurry up, James.

67
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,000
What a slowpoke.

68
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,080
-Nick.
-What?

69
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,000
-Where are you taking me?
-In this room...

70
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,320
someone hanged herself here.

71
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,800
Super scary.

72
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,960
Stop whining, James.

73
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,520
-That's Biew, not me.
-It's you.

74
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
James, why are you shaking?

75
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,120
I'm just cold.

76
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,000
-That's the owner's bed?
-How should I know?

77
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,520
-Biew.
-What the fuck do you want?

78
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,800
You.

79
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,320
Why not James?

80
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,120
-You do it.
-You do it.

81
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,320
Shit. Just do it already.

82
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,160
Why are you shaking?

83
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Sacred monk charm, please help me...

84
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,920
Jesus!

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,520
Jesus what? I'm doing it.

86
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,880
I think I've found it.

87
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,480
-Found what?
-Ghost.

88
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,760
Ghost?

89
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,760
Yes.

90
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,960
Why are you telling me this?

91
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,840
Well, you said I should tell you
if I saw something.

92
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,120
You don't need to tell me anything!

93
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,720
Where is it?

94
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,960
Up there.

95
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,960
-James.
-What?

96
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,040
You look.

97
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,120
-Why don't you look yourself?
-I'm busy...

98
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,440
poking this.

99
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,040
You look.

100
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,320
I'm also busy.

101
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm praying.

102
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,200
Why are you messing around right now?

103
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,040
Look at the same time.

104
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,760
One...

105
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,200
Two...

106
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,840
Three.

107
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,000
It's only me.

108
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,280
-What did you find?
-A ghost!

109
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,520
-That way!
-This way!

110
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,880
What the hell are you afraid of?
She's a cutie.

111
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,840
You morons.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,840
Nick, you asshole! Why did you bring it?

113
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,840
What the hell are you afraid of?

114
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,520
She's a cutie.

115
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,240
She's got quite the moves.

116
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,000
MAKE ME SHUDDER

117
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,600
James. The semester's done.
What do you want?

118
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,680
-About what?
-The thing we talked about.

119
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,640
Why did you stop? You forgot?
Or are you chicken?

120
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,120
What do you mean, chicken? Let's go.

121
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,600
I thought you were chicken.
That night you ran the fastest.

122
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,000
I was regrouping,
so I can go back and help in time.

123
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,760
You guys just don't get me.

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,360
-Benz, I have something to show you.
-Where?

125
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,760
-That other night.
-What?

126
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,040
I was there. I brought these two...

127
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,000
-but they waited outside.
-What?

128
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,320
I even have evidence for you. Here.

129
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,840
-Pale as a ghost.
-Hello, teacher.

130
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,760
Weren't you scared?

131
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,880
Me? I'm never scared.

132
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,680
Not scared my ass!
Your scream was loud as hell, Biew.

133
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,080
That was James. All him.

134
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,000
So what about tonight?

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,320
Just wait for those two.
Nick has everything planned.

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,960
Here they come.

137
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,760
Hey. Are you guys ready for tonight?

138
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,920
-Yes. Ready.
-Me too.

139
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,000
And you?

140
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,760
-Yeah. Whatever.
-Just don't mess with my bangs.

141
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,320
-I'm ready.
-Here's the plan.

142
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,800
Listen to me.

143
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,280
Okay. Okay.

144
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,240
You guys follow my plan.

145
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,000
It goes like this.

146
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,440
-All clear. Let's go.
-Quick.

147
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,920
There's no one.

148
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,640
-Where are you guys going?
-Home.

149
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,680
What about tonight? You're not coming?

150
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,080
-No. I'm scared.
-Me too.

151
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
Scared of what?

152
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,160
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

153
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,320
-Where are you going?
-Home.

154
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,680
What about our plans?
You're not coming?

155
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,840
-No. I'm scared.
-Me too.

156
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,400
Scared of what?

157
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,800
-Goodbye. We have to go.
-Come.

158
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,360
Come with us.

159
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,200
I'm not going. I haven't told my mom yet.

160
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,200
-Give me her number. I'll call.
-But she speaks English.

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,120
James. You call.

162
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,480
Shit. Just give me the dirty work.

163
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,080
Let's go.

164
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
-I'm not going.
-Let's go.

165
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,600
-No.
-Hurry up.

166
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,280
Do you know why we're not allowed
to enter this building?

167
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,440
-Because the doors are locked?
-Locked my ass. It's becasue someone died.

168
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,840
-It was a 12th grader.
-A girl?

169
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,520
Our school's boys only, stupid.

170
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,720
Couldn't make admission. Stressed out.

171
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,480
-So he went up to that corner on the roof.
-Must be the second floor.

172
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,040
I said roof!

173
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
He jumped.

174
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,680
Hit his head.
Bashed one side of his skull in.

175
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,120
-Is he disabled?
-He's dead!

176
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,520
-Dead?
-Yes.

177
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
-He's dead?
-Yes.

178
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,840
I'm going to take you all in to see.

179
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,800
Hey! Any ghost who thinks he's powerful...

180
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,840
like, an uber-scary one,

181
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,160
I...

182
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,320
and my friends...

183
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,440
and friends of my friends...
will go in to let you haunt us.

184
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,480
Lord Buddha, please protect me.

185
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,600
-Lord Buddha, please protect me...
-What's with you, Brian?

186
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,360
This is uber-scary.

187
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,040
Uber your dad.

188
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,000
-You're insulting my dad?
-Yes.

189
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,760
-I'm telling my mommy.
-Go ahead.

190
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,200
-Is it a ghost?
-Ghost my ass. Hurry up.

191
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,280
Hurry up.

192
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Hurry up.

193
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,680
You guys are shaking so much.
Is it really that scary?

194
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
What are you two moaning about?

195
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,000
{\an8}DO NOT ENTER
BEFORE GIVEN PERMISSION

196
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,800
Hurry up, you guys. Follow me.

197
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,200
We're here. This is the entrance.

198
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,080
Nick... Are we really going inside?

199
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,840
-Why? You're scared?
-No.

200
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,600
-Have you... yet?
-What?

201
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,720
-Have you... yet?
-What?

202
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,640
Have you... yet?

203
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,800
What permission?

204
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,200
This one. The sign says so.

205
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,640
Do not enter before given permission.

206
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Come here, boy.

207
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,880
-Permission your dad.
-Hey!

208
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,760
-You're insulting my dad's friend?
-Friend's dad.

209
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,240
I'll insult yours too, Brian.

210
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,600
-I'm telling my mommy.
-No need to tell her.

211
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,960
I bet she knows already.

212
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,880
-Let's go.
-Hey!

213
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,560
Brian!

214
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,600
-Where are you going?
-What are you doing?

215
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,520
What's up with you, Brian?

216
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,880
-Worshiping the Buddha.
-This is a spirit house.

217
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,240
Brian. What are you chanting?

218
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,800
I'm praying.

219
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,800
That's not a prayer.
That's the five precepts.

220
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,440
What about you guys? Not joining him?

221
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,920
-Nick!
-What's up?

222
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,760
Remember the spirit house you trashed?

223
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,640
You want me to trash this one?

224
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,440
The spirits in that one followed us.

225
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,800
Where?

226
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,160
Where did they go?

227
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,560
Where?

228
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,080
-Between those two buildings.
-There's nothing there.

229
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,520
Yes, there is.

230
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,000
-Are you really going in, Nick?
-Why else would I be here?

231
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,680
Ghosts! Get ready to haunt!

232
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,560
Nick!

233
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,560
What?

234
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,360
-Nick.
-Hurry up.

235
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,240
This place may have some sort of energy.

236
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,280
Stop setting the mood.
We're scared enough as it is.

237
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,760
Biew. Say this,
"Come out! I want to see you!" Say it.

238
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,600
-Why has it got to be me?
-It's got to be you!

239
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,680
-There are four or five others.
-You say it. Quick.

240
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,000
-I want to see you.
-Loudly.

241
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,120
-I want to see you.
-Louder!

242
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,240
-I want to see you! Come out!
-Foulmouthed.

243
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,720
Maybe tonight... all of us...
will feel the presence of some spirits.

244
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,560
Stop it, Nick.

245
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,320
Stop it, James. What's up with you?

246
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,240
I saw... Up there. I saw...

247
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,000
Where? What did you guys see?

248
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,680
-Nothing.
-Then why did you scream?

249
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,480
We just joined in.

250
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,760
Get up, all of you.

251
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,600
-I really did see it.
-Get up. Quick.

252
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,520
James.

253
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,280
Next time you see something,
don't tell us.

254
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,000
-I really did see it.
-Just hurry up.

255
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,120
Hurry up.

256
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,240
You're breaking things.

257
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,320
I will lead you guys upstairs.

258
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,120
You ghosts upstairs!
My friends and I are coming up!

259
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,440
Nick! Can I stay here?

260
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,840
Will you come up willingly,
or should I drag you by the ear?

261
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,640
-Fine, I'll come up.
-We're coming!

262
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,440
Hurry up.

263
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,760
-Hey! Who pulled me?
-What the heck is up with you?

264
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,320
-What is that?
-It's nothing.

265
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,000
You guys are so scared
that you're seeing things.

266
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,440
Seeing things my ass!

267
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,440
-You said there's nothing, Nick!
-It's all in your head.

268
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Let's go.

269
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,720
James, help me.

270
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,400
-Come on in.
-Nope. We're scared.

271
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,720
You guys want to see me, right?

272
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,240
Wait for me!

273
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,360
James! What are you doing there?

274
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,040
My legs won't go!

275
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
I said open!

276
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,080
I said open!

277
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,720
Let's go, Biew!

278
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Help me!

279
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,520
Wait for me!

280
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,240
Wait for me!

281
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
My shoe!

282
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Let go!

283
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,160
Let go! Let go!

284
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,320
Let go! Let go!

285
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,160
Nick! Wait for me!

286
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,160
Where are you going? Down here.

287
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,720
I'm scared.

288
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,960
-Where's James?
-Forget him.

289
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,200
Help! Help me!

290
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,240
Mr. Saman, can you hear kids yelling?

291
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,680
Yes.

292
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,760
Why haven't these kids gone home?

293
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,760
How about I go and take a look?

294
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,920
Good. I'll come with.

295
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,040
Sure. After you.

296
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,520
-Where did James go?
-I don't know!

297
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,120
-Where are they?
-I don't know where they went!

298
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,640
-Help! Help me!
-Hey!

299
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,320
On your left!

300
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,520
-I don't see shit!
-On my right!

301
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,760
-Come on. Hurry!
-The door's locked.

302
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,920
It won't open.

303
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,800
Hurry!

304
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,200
-Help me.
-Hurry up!

305
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,960
-Hurry up. This way!
-This way!

306
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,360
He's coming.

307
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,880
It's uber-scary!

308
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,280
-James.
-What?

309
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,640
You're acting was amazing.
Where did you learn that?

310
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,240
Of course, it was amazing.
I'm the king of acting.

311
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,040
Biew wasn't bad either.
That scream was like, damn!

312
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,960
How can I let James up stage me?

313
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,240
But I saw him go really pale.
Screamed like a little girl.

314
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,680
What about that ghost?

315
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,600
Oh yeah. Hey, James.

316
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,640
Where'd you get the mushy-headed-ghost?
He looked so real!

317
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,560
Did you see it? The brain was oozing,
and oozing...

318
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
down this side...

319
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,080
-So real.
-But I didn't hire him.

320
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,000
It had to be Nick.

321
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,000
-It's a double trick.
-I didn't hire him.

322
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,400
I didn't hire him!

323
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,320
James...

324
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,120
Nick....

325
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,520
and I...

326
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,960
didn't hire anyone.

327
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,800
Then who?

328
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,240
James! Is this a prank or is it for real?

329
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,240
It's for real!

330
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,520
It's an abandoned building!
Who would take a shit here at this time?

331
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,920
Biew, go take a look.

332
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,440
-Me again?
-Yes.

333
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,160
-I'm too scared.
-Hurry.

334
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,880
Here I go.

335
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,200
-I'm actually going now.
-Just hurry up.

336
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,040
There's nothing in here.

337
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,880
You're right... There's nothing.

338
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,680
Shit. You two love me so much, huh?

339
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,280
Typical. Biew,
I told you there was nothing.

340
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,120
Can't you see? Empty stall.

341
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,440
Why so scared?

342
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,520
But I really heard it.
James, Nick, you guys heard it too.

343
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,240
Or else why would you scream?

344
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,840
Hey...

345
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,400
Or...

346
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,680
it was the senior who jump--

347
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,840
Biew...

348
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,040
Now he's quiet.

349
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
Let go.

350
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,240
Let go!

351
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
Let me go.

352
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,880
-I say we get out of here.
-Let go...

353
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,640
-You're leaving your friend behind?
-Let go...

354
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,800
I'm not leaving him behind.
I just have to go regroup.

355
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,640
I'll count to three. Then, run.

356
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,240
One...

357
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,840
Two...

358
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,960
Three!

359
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,880
Nick!

360
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,840
-Ghost!
-What?

361
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,680
-Which way should we go?
-What should we do?

362
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,600
What now?

363
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,320
There's a ghost this way too.

364
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
Oil!

365
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,600
Are you okay?

366
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,160
I think he's possessed.

367
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,800
Go hold him down. Help hold him down.

368
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,280
I'll do it.

369
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,080
-Nick, hold this.
-Okay.

370
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,000
You guys, hold him down.

371
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,840
-Oil.
-Hurry up.

372
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,080
Demon. Be gone!

373
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,400
Be gone!

374
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,040
Be gone!

375
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,240
Be gone!

376
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
What?

377
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,480
-What did he say?
-He said "bastard."

378
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,400
What?

379
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,960
What?

380
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,400
-What did he say?
-He said he's got epilepsy.

381
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,880
-Find something to shove into his mouth.
-I'll do it.

382
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,520
-Hurry up.
-Is he okay?

383
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,640
Hold him.

384
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,080
James.

385
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,800
Really? You're really doing this?

386
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,240
Hold him down.

387
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,440
-James. Stop squeezing so hard!
-It hurts!

388
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,560
Hey!

389
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,080
Ghost!

390
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,560
Take your bangs back!

391
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,840
Help me adjust my bangs first!

392
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,840
Nick!

393
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,400
Oil, let me go!

394
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,880
Let me go!

395
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,920
Bit so hard I'm bleeding. Bastard.

396
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,360
-Which way?
-That way!

397
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,040
Where's Oil?

398
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,080
Oil...

399
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,960
-We should help Oil!
-Wait for me!

400
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,960
-Let's go help him.
-That's right. Oil.

401
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,280
Wait. Let's go help him first.

402
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,080
Go ahead...

403
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,240
-The noise must have come from this way.
-Yes.

404
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,280
I think it's upstairs.

405
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,040
How about this?

406
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,400
Mr. Saman, you check upstairs,
and I'll check downstairs.

407
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Okay.

408
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,440
Be careful.

409
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,600
Thank you.

410
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,680
-Oil. Hey. Where's Oil?
-Oil.

411
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,600
Oil.

412
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,240
-Oil, where are you?
-Oil.

413
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,440
-Oil.
-Oil, where are you?

414
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,680
-Maybe he already went downstairs.
-Yeah. Let's go find him.

415
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,960
Oil.

416
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,920
It's locked.

417
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,920
What now?

418
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,840
Hey. I'm out of juice.

419
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,720
Nick.

420
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,000
I shouldn't have come with you.
You son of a bitch.

421
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,040
-Nick. He called you a bitch.
-I can hear.

422
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,440
He said "son of a bitch" not bitch!

423
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,160
I bet it's all fine now.

424
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,920
What are you so afraid of?
Look at James. He's fine.

425
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,080
Nick. Let me in.

426
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,520
-Why did you have to bud in?
-I need warmth.

427
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,360
Brian!

428
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,600
Help me!

429
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
What's going on?

430
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,400
-Pull him down!
-I'm pulling.

431
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,880
-Help him!
-Why aren't you helping?

432
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,600
Brian.

433
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,840
-Help me.
-Come down.

434
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,120
I'm holding. Can't you see?

435
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,680
Bring me down.

436
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,240
Help me, please.

437
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,360
Seniors.

438
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,080
Did you guys see what I saw?

439
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,000
Yes!

440
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,280
He's behind us, isn't he?

441
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,360
I'm not sure.

442
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,920
Then I'll count to three,
and we all turn to look.

443
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,920
One...

444
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,320
Two...

445
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,440
Three! Can you see anything?

446
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,640
Why didn't you turn?

447
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,640
I'm scared!

448
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,520
Scared of what?

449
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,400
Biew! Hurry!

450
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,640
Hurry up!

451
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,320
Hurry up!

452
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,640
Hurry up!

453
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,440
My face.

454
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,320
Ouch! My leg. Ouch!

455
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,200
-Hurry up!
-Come on!

456
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,440
Let's go.

457
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,840
Help me!

458
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,560
Hey! Wait for me!

459
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,440
Biew and James, wait for me!

460
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,640
Hey! Biew!

461
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,000
Biew!

462
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,480
Help me first!

463
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,360
Why do you have pull so hard?

464
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,960
-Why are you holding me?
-Didn't you want to meet me?

465
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,520
You're the senior
who killed himself here, right?

466
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,480
Yes.

467
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,760
-What did you do that for?
-I failed the admission.

468
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,720
-That's no reason to kill yourself.
-I was disappointed!

469
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,200
-What was your first choice for admission?
-Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital.

470
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,440
-Medicine at Siriraj...
-Second choice?

471
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,360
Medicine, Chulalongkorn University.

472
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,240
-And third choice?
-Medicine, Chiang Mai University.

473
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,520
-And fourth choice?
-Medicine, Thammasart!

474
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,880
In 12th grade,

475
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,960
-what was your GPA?
-1.2.

476
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,960
Dumbass! If I were you, I'd kill myself
back when I got my grades.

477
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,320
-What about your GPA?
-Me?

478
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,920
-I got 0.58.
-No different.

479
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,760
You guys should come join me!

480
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,960
Get ready to join me.

481
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,000
-It's a dead end.
-Dead end!

482
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,600
-Climb!
-Biew! Why are you climbing?

483
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,160
-It's a dead end.
-It's a dead end.

484
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,400
-Hurry up. Run.
-Is this a dead end?

485
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,880
Biew, James, help me!

486
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,080
-The ghost!
-Biew, James, help me!

487
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,320
Help me.

488
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,360
No way! Ghost!

489
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,520
Biew

490
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,320
-Help me.
-No way. Ghost.

491
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,280
Nick...

492
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,360
-Biew, why did you stop!
-Fuck you! I'm scared.

493
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,040
You're not going to help Nick?

494
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,800
I'm not going in,
unless you're all going too.

495
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,920
Nick!

496
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,760
-Nick!
-Nick.

497
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,440
Nick!

498
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,560
It's so dark.

499
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,040
Can't see anything.

500
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,280
-Biew, James, help me.
-Nick! Hurry!

501
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,080
-Come out!
-Come out. Hurry!

502
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,080
-Biew...
-Hurry up. Crawl over. Quick.

503
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,640
-Hurry up, Nick.
-I'm too scared to go there.

504
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,920
-Hurry up!
-Come over here!

505
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,800
-Just a little further.
-Nick. Hurry up.

506
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,240
-Nick.
-Hurry!

507
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,000
Biew, I'm scared.

508
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,760
Shit.

509
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,720
Biew, what do we do now?

510
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,560
Biew...

511
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,960
-Biew.
-Biew...

512
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,480
Nick.

513
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,360
Nick.

514
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,640
-James!
-James.

515
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,480
Nick.

516
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,280
James.

517
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,880
Stop.

518
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,800
-What's the matter with you?
-I'm hurt.

519
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,280
Fine.

520
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,000
Nick.

521
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,200
Where is he?

522
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,960
Hey! Let go of my friend!

523
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,840
That's enough.

524
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,800
Guys, hurry!

525
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,720
Net!

526
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,360
Hurry! Hurry!

527
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,160
What's all the commotion?

528
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,880
Hello, Miss.

529
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,120
Do you know that students
are not allowed in this building?

530
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,840
Yes, Miss.

531
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,040
Yes? Then why did you come up here?

532
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,040
You're challenging me?

533
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,040
-But there's a ghost downstairs, Miss.
-That's right.

534
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,520
What ghost?

535
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,160
-Then I'll go--
-Nick!

536
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,920
There's a ghost downstairs.

537
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,760
Miss, may we please stay with you tonight?

538
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,520
-Please, Miss.
-Please.

539
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,680
If you want to stay here, follow me.

540
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,640
Quick.

541
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,520
-I said follow me!
-Let's go, Brian.

542
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,840
-James. Who is this teacher?
-How am I suppose to know. Just walk.

543
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,440
Go on.

544
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,320
Net. Come on.

545
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,120
Why are you guys holding on to me?

546
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
Walk faster.

547
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,800
Wait in here for now.

548
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,120
In here, Miss?

549
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,280
That's right!

550
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,320
-Hurry up! Go inside!
-Yes, Miss.

551
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,360
It's so dark.

552
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,480
-Miss!
-Miss?

553
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,080
Why does she have to lock us in here?

554
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,360
Shit. It's so dark.

555
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,160
Biew.

556
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,120
Would you guys rather be outside?

557
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
Eager to see the mushy-headed-ghost?

558
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,360
Hey, guys. Let's look for a candle.

559
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,960
My battery is almost dead.

560
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,160
Biew. James.

561
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,400
Go search over there.
Maybe there's a candle.

562
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,640
-James. You go.
-You go, Biew.

563
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,280
-Me again?
-Yes, you. Hurry up.

564
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,040
Hey. Light the way for me.

565
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,440
Shit.

566
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,600
Biew. Be careful.

567
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,360
How am I supposed
to find something in the dark?

568
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,600
Why are you two standing around?
Go help him find it.

569
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,280
It's so dark I can't see anything.

570
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,560
Net. There's a light switch.
Go take a look.

571
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,560
Sure.

572
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,120
Doesn't work.

573
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,360
You, check there.

574
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,880
Shit. It's my lucky day.
I found new shoes.

575
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,840
Found it!

576
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,360
What did you find?

577
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,800
-Nick.
-What is it?

578
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,920
Here's our candle.

579
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,920
Go fetch it.

580
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,840
Biew, come one. Go fetch it.

581
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,840
Quickly. Step on my hands. Hurry.

582
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,120
-Hurry.
-Shit head! There are chairs everywhere.

583
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,560
Shit. I'm so scared I forgot. Quick.

584
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,080
Shit. How are we suppose to light it?

585
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,360
Biew, check up there for some matches.

586
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,360
Found it.

587
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,960
-James, hold this.
-Sure.

588
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,080
Hurry up already.

589
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,120
Maybe she's back to open the door for us.

590
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,560
Miss! Miss!

591
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,400
Miss! Miss!

592
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,720
Biew...

593
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,120
Go over there.

594
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,560
I said go over there.

595
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,680
Stop!

596
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,440
I said stop.

597
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,640
Just stay right here. Don't follow me.

598
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,000
I'm out of here!

599
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,160
Wait for me.

600
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,920
The dented-headed-ghost is staring at us.

601
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,760
James, what are you holding that for?
Give me the candle.

602
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,480
-Biew, where are the matches?
-Here!

603
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,920
How did the fucking ghost get it?

604
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,440
-I don't know.
-Biew.

605
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,160
Go get it.

606
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,600
Stop whining! Go get them.

607
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,960
Hey... Can you just give them back nicely?

608
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,920
-Come at get them yourself.
-James. He told you to go get them.

609
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
He told you to go, bastard!

610
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,520
Then you two go.

611
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,200
Fucking no way!

612
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,680
-You then.
-No way, Brian. I'm scared.

613
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,080
Go.

614
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,000
Biew. Go get them.

615
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,160
-Me?
-Yes!

616
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,400
-Me?
-Yes!

617
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,400
Go on.

618
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,880
Can you give me the matches?

619
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,360
I want the matches, not your hand!

620
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,280
Please, give me the matches.

621
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,000
Please?

622
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,160
Dropped...

623
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,320
The matches dropped.

624
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,840
Then pick them up!

625
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,360
Promise you won't do anything?

626
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,720
I promise.

627
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,440
-Wait! It's only a temporary promise.
-Temporary is fine.

628
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,200
Time's up.

629
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,320
-Where are you, Oil?
-Oil.

630
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,800
-Oil.
-Where are you, Oil?

631
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,360
Oil! Oil is here.

632
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,840
Help me with him. Are you alright?

633
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,480
Oil, how did you get here?

634
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,040
Oil.

635
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,560
Hold him up higher.

636
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,960
How are you, Oil?

637
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,600
-Are you okay?
-Tape...

638
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,800
Ghost.

639
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,760
Nick, what the hell are you doing?
Why don't you go to sleep?

640
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,240
I'm not sleepy.

641
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,760
-How about you?
-How do you expect me to sleep...

642
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,040
with this damn ghost staring at my face,

643
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,280
waiting for a chance to haunt me?

644
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:55,960
Nick.

645
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,840
-What?
-Where are Oil and those guys?

646
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,600
They've disappeared.

647
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,320
You're right.
I think they've probably gone home.

648
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,080
There's a pillow.

649
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,600
Hey, you guys should get some sleep.
The teacher should let us out tomorrow.

650
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,600
If your friend has these symptoms again,
you can't just play around.

651
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,600
Find a spoon or something hard
for him to bite on.

652
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,920
Or else he might bite off his tongue.

653
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,360
-Yes, Miss.
-Yes.

654
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,800
Apart from you, are there others?

655
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,000
Miss Wanpen.

656
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,880
Come this way, please.
I need to discuss something

657
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,200
Okay.

658
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,640
Just a minute.

659
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,200
You three remember,

660
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,200
don't go anywhere.

661
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,480
If the two of us aren't back,

662
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,000
you must stay in this room. Understood?

663
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,720
Yes, Miss.

664
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,760
Let's go.

665
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,440
Hey, Tape.

666
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,080
What's today?

667
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,680
What is it, Oil?

668
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,800
Can you find a calendar for me?

669
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,080
Benz, go look.

670
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,280
Is something wrong?

671
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,600
Are you okay?

672
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,080
-Any better?
-Here's a calendar.

673
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,760
Is something wrong?

674
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,880
The 10th...

675
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,840
with new moon...

676
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,440
Hey, you two,

677
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,640
remember the story I told you
at the dorm that night?

678
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,520
See the building next door?

679
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,160
-Paraminwittayakom building.
-Nick.

680
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,840
Don't tell me...

681
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,920
you're telling a...

682
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,200
a...

683
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,400
-a ghost story!
-Of course, I am.

684
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,480
Don't be afraid, little one.

685
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,520
Daddy's here.

686
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,840
James, if you're scared,

687
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,920
you best carry your little one outside.

688
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,480
Fine. I will.

689
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,360
You're not stopping me?

690
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,920
Then I'm not going.

691
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,040
-This building--
-Nick.

692
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,120
You're really telling it?

693
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,000
This late at night?

694
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,000
-It's so scary at this time.
-Tape, you shit head.

695
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,040
What the hell are you scared of?

696
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,600
Have you seen the ghost hunt
in the show "Ghost Display"?

697
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,280
All of the homes that are haunted,

698
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,400
the three of us have treaded.

699
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,800
Are you going to listen?

700
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,000
This building was built in 1957.

701
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,400
It's 50 years old.

702
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,440
But the building you're seeing today
is a new building,

703
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,640
built on top of the old one.

704
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,920
And do you know why it's haunted?

705
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,760
A senior student,

706
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,840
grade 12...

707
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,640
was very good in school...
but couldn't make admission.

708
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,320
Thus, he decided to kill himself.

709
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,680
But that's not what I've heard at all.

710
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,520
They say...

711
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,200
before they demolished the old building...

712
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,360
some teachers killed each other
in that building.

713
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,520
And whenever it's an 8th night
of the waning moon...

714
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,240
or a new moon

715
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:54,320
someone would see that teacher
walking around the building.

716
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,200
People around there got so frightened.

717
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,640
Spooky, right?

718
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,760
Then, this next school break,
I'll take you all for an adventure.

719
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,520
Let's see whose story...

720
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,160
is the true story.

721
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,880
That means your story is true.

722
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,120
Yeah.

723
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,360
Tape, I say we leave.

724
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,760
But the teacher said to wait here.

725
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,640
Wait for what?

726
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,440
Then let's go tell Nick and the gang.

727
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,640
Let's go.

728
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,240
Biew.

729
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,000
Brian.

730
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,920
Where the hell are you guys?

731
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,880
I'm here.

732
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,760
Who gave you permission to enter?

733
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,600
Leave this place this instant!

734
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,000
And never return again!
Take your friends with you!

735
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,480
-Go!
-Okay.

736
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,080
Hey, everybody!

737
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,280
Why won't you leave us alone?

738
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:14,000
Let me hit him. I'll hit him.

739
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,240
Wait! Stop!

740
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,760
I need to take this.

741
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,680
-Hello, Nick.
-What kind of ghost has a phone?

742
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,320
This isn't Nick.

743
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,720
-He's a northerner.
-May I speak with Nick, please?

744
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,560
Who's Nick?

745
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,600
I am.

746
00:58:58,920 --> 00:58:59,840
It's for you.

747
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,920
-Hello?
-Hello, Nick. Where are you?

748
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,440
Why aren't you home by now?

749
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,200
Jenny? Hello?

750
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,520
Jenny. Hello?

751
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,240
It's dead.

752
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,160
Hey, ghost.

753
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,200
-How did you get my phone?
-I'm a ghost.

754
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,720
I can take your things when ever I want.

755
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,880
Want a flashlight?

756
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,360
I even have a lighter.

757
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,240
Quit babbling.

758
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,200
Guys,

759
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,520
-beat him up!
-Wait.

760
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,200
I'll go get your mom to come play with.

761
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,640
-Why are you so scared?
-Son of a bitch!

762
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,240
Told you so.

763
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,560
There's no such thing as ghosts.

764
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,240
It's all in your head.

765
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:12,000
See? Told you so.
Ghosts don't exist. Chickens.

766
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,200
Give me that flashlight.
Let me see that face.

767
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,240
I knew you're not a real ghost.

768
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,600
I was just pretending.

769
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,720
-James.
-Son of a bitch!

770
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,960
Made me run all that distance.

771
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,440
-James.
-Huh?

772
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,240
-Guard him.
-Me?

773
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,200
Yes.

774
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,400
You made me run upstairs
and now I have to guard you.

775
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,640
Stop following me.
I'm going to take a piss.

776
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,320
Hold this.

777
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,560
Nick! The book opened by itself!

778
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,560
What kind of book opens by itself?

779
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,800
The wind blew it.

780
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,240
I saw it too, though.

781
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,600
It really did open by itself.
You're as crazy as he is.

782
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,200
The wind? What wind?
I didn't feel any wind.

783
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,080
-I really did see it, James.
-Where?

784
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,680
Buzz off.

785
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,040
Did you see it, Biew?

786
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,400
Ghosts don't exist.

787
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,760
If I see one, I'll piss on it.

788
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,640
And if I don't see any,
I'll curse them all to eternal limbo.

789
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,160
If it's a child ghost, I'll punt kick it.

790
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,480
If it's a male ghost,
I'll piss on his damn face.

791
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:54,240
And for the female one, I'll rape her.
But give me a pretty one.

792
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,480
Nick! Is this her?

793
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,560
Nick! Is this her?

794
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,120
Miss Pannee Rattanawiset.

795
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,280
Birth: August 2nd,

796
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,080
1925

797
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,760
Death: July 13th,

798
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,080
1962

799
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,160
-She's definitely dead.
-Yeah, she's dead.

800
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,560
Hold this.

801
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,400
"The fighting of teachers
at Poramin School

802
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,160
lead to the death of teachers

803
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,960
in the classroom M. 6/5."

804
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,000
Does anyone know what room this is?

805
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,640
When we came in,
I saw that it was room M. 6/4.

806
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,600
CLASSROOM M. 6/4

807
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,920
What a relief.

808
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,280
-James.
-What?

809
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,320
Point the light to the photo again.

810
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,720
Me?

811
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,600
Who was that?

812
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,040
We don't want the teacher to hear.

813
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,120
Hey. Someone's coming.

814
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,480
How can she be here?
Let's get out of here.

815
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,160
Do you think it's her?

816
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,440
I think it has to be her.

817
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,760
What do we do?

818
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,400
What do we do? I'm scared.

819
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,920
There's a buddha image at the front.
Someone go get it.

820
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,720
Who?

821
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,320
Fine. I'll do it.

822
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,000
James, light the way for me.

823
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,280
And you guys find somewhere to hide.

824
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,600
Don't make a sound.

825
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,280
-Hurry.
-Keep the light steady.

826
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,080
Come on. Hurry up.

827
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,320
Nick, hurry up.

828
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,440
-Just climb, or it'll be too late.
-I know.

829
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,320
-Nick!
-Are you okay?

830
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,440
M. 6/5

831
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,160
M. 6/5...

832
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,160
She's back.

833
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,000
Who wants to see me?

834
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,080
-Come here!
-Brian!

835
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,320
Let me go.

836
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:43,920
Miss...

837
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,360
Stop it, Pannee. How much more
bad karma do you want.

838
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,720
Leave me be.

839
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,560
Brian!

840
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,720
Was it you?

841
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,800
No, Miss.

842
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,280
-Then it was you!
-No, Miss. No, Miss...

843
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,080
Teacher, I'm sorry.

844
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,600
Nick, where's the Buddha image?

845
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,680
Who cares? Just get out of here.

846
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,960
I can't hear you!

847
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,200
Chant loudly.

848
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,440
Louder!

849
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:48,840
-Still can't hear you!
-I'm scared, Miss.

850
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,480
Stop!

851
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,440
You're trying to run from me?

852
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,200
Nick, what do we do?

853
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,480
You must come stay with me!
I am taking you with me!

854
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:13,920
You must come stay with me!
I am taking you with me!

855
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:38,880
James.

856
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,040
James.

857
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,680
James.

858
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,920
What?

859
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,000
Biew.

860
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:48,640
Biew.

861
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,320
What is this place?

862
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,280
-How did we get here?
-Who am I suppose to go and ask?

863
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:10,040
-Brian. Hey, Brian. Net.
-Tape.

864
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,080
-Tape, wake up.
-Oil, wake up.

865
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,560
Where the hell is this place?

866
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,080
What are you standing around for?
Follow me.

867
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,280
Nick.

868
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,080
Where's Benz?

869
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,000
How am I suppose to know?

870
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,880
I say we should take a look inside.

871
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,280
-Maybe he's inside.
-Nick, wait for me!

872
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,000
Give me the flashlight!

873
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,720
Poraminwittaya School.

874
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,680
That's our school.

875
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,760
Nick, can you remember
the story I told you?

876
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,080
Some teachers killed each other
in this building.

877
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,120
We already met the teachers.

878
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,600
They are--

879
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,800
What are they?

880
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,800
They are teachers, Miss.

881
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,560
You know where this is, don't you?

882
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,600
I'll help you find a way out.

883
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,200
I will not let you leave!

884
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,280
How dare you challenge me?

885
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,320
Pannee.

886
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,560
-Please, stop.
-I will not!

887
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,000
These kids...

888
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,960
need a teacher like me!

889
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,160
Benz! Benz!

890
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,440
Stand back, kids.

891
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,160
Go!

892
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,640
Biew, hurry up!

893
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,600
-I'm gone!
-Biew!

894
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,240
Biew! Come on!

895
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,240
Excuse me, sir.

896
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,280
-James.
-James.

897
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,400
Help me.

898
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,440
Which way should we go?
This way or that way?

899
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,720
That way! Biew!

900
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,560
James, how did you get here?

901
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,520
I don't know either!

902
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,840
Look! My pants are all ripped.

903
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,960
Help me think, Chip the Ghost.

904
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,520
That's not my name. It's Mark.

905
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,160
I don't care if you're Mark or Moron!

906
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,600
Just help me think!

907
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,600
-What do you want from me?
-Just hurry up. They're coming.

908
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,640
Shit. What do we do?

909
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,040
You kids have never feared
or respected teachers, have you?

910
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:15,760
-Not true. We're scared to death of you.
-Liars.

911
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,760
You insulted me.
That's why you dared to come here.

912
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,680
-We didn't insult you, Miss--
-Hush!

913
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,000
Don't argue!

914
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,680
-I'm not arguing.
-This is called arguing.

915
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,440
Don't you even think
that I'll let you out of here so easily.

916
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,880
Teacher. Please don't hurt us.

917
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,920
I said don't argue!

918
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,120
Pannee.

919
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,880
Get out of here, kids.

920
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,160
That's enough, Pannee.

921
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,560
These kids are like your students.

922
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,680
These rascals are not my students!

923
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,520
They don't respect you...

924
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,960
because you're like this!

925
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:03,200
That's right, Pannee.
You have a bad temper.

926
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,040
That's why no one loves you.

927
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,600
Including you, Mr. Saman?

928
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:15,760
Yes.

929
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,560
You can both die together then!

930
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,440
Hey. The ghosts are getting closer.

931
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,000
Where are they?

932
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,520
Hurry up! Hurry up!

933
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,800
Still needs blood.

934
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,880
The blood has dried out.

935
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,800
I didn't bring any extra.

936
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,400
Is that your toe? It's really bloody.

937
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,440
I can't reach!

938
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,640
You suck on it.

939
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:47,920
Suck it!

940
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,520
Hurry up.

941
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,200
Still not enough.

942
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,560
Suck again. Suck it.

943
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,080
-Is it realistic?
-It's super realistic.

944
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,360
-Go out and fight them!
-Hurry up.

945
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,920
Hey. Are they afraid of you?

946
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,720
You will fear me.

947
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,240
You will fear me!

948
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,360
Stupid ghosts.

949
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,800
CLASSROOM M. 6/5

950
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,520
Be careful, man.

951
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,000
Benz! Benz! Benz!

952
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,000
Benz!

953
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,920
Is he dead? Benz!

954
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,520
He's not moving!

955
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,760
I think he's dead, man!

956
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,520
Benz!

957
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,160
-Let's just go.
-Yeah. I say forget him.

958
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:42,200
-Forget him? Where are you going?
-I'm going home.

959
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,120
Go find Nick and the gang first.

960
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,280
Benz!

961
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,280
Let go of me! Let go!

962
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:02,840
-I'm not dead! Help me.
-Benz isn't dead.

963
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,440
-Hurry. Help him, quick.
-Benz.

964
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,600
Help him up. Let's go. Hurry.

965
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:23,880
Mark, hurry up.

966
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,680
There are people here.

967
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,400
Why are they studying at night?

968
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,480
Are they going to be alright?

969
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,760
There they are. Let's go.

970
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,480
Why are you goons standing around?

971
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,400
Where were you?

972
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,240
-Save the questions. Let's just run.
-Let's go.

973
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,600
"Curator"

974
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,040
reads cu-ra-tor.

975
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,200
Write it down.

976
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,160
Where did the light come from? Go hide!

977
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,720
...reads de-struc-tion.

978
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,040
Write it down.

979
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,680
Students, leave the room.

980
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,960
I need to talk to Miss Wanpen.

981
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,120
Hurry up!

982
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,800
What's up with her?

983
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,120
How did Miss Wanpen get here?

984
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,040
She was just helping us.

985
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,360
You're right.

986
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,520
Quiet.

987
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,160
What is it, Pannee?

988
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,560
Are you having an affair with Mr. Saman?

989
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:42,880
No.

990
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,320
Pannee!

991
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,400
It's not Wanpen's fault.

992
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:51,880
It's all on me.

993
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,960
That means you both admit
that you're having an affair.

994
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,560
No one loves you...
because you're like this.

995
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,640
Including you, Mr. Saman?

996
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,400
Yes.

997
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,520
You love each other so much, don't you?

998
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,760
You can both die together then.

999
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,200
Pannee!

1000
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,240
-Pannee.
-Let go of me!

1001
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:27,280
Mr. Saman!

1002
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,760
Pannee!

1003
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,160
Is this worth killing each other for?

1004
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,760
So all the teachers are actually ghosts?

1005
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,320
Miss Pannee!

1006
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:41,440
Guys, follow me. I know the way out.

1007
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,800
That way! Hurry!

1008
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,080
Quick, follow me.

1009
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,240
Is he okay?

1010
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,040
-James...
-Your mouth...

1011
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,400
Miss Pannee slapped me, silly.

1012
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,120
Never mind that. Follow me.

1013
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,280
You rascals! You think you can escape me?

1014
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,040
Guys! There's the exit!

1015
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,240
Where?

1016
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,040
Let's go!

1017
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,960
Please, don't hurt us.

1018
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,520
Stop following us!

1019
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,480
Is it you who disrespects your teachers?

1020
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,520
No, Miss.

1021
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,720
-Please don't hurt my friend. Hurt me.
-Biew!

1022
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,840
Stay out of this!

1023
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:51,680
Teacher...

1024
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,680
Hurt me instead.

1025
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:03,320
Kids who disrespect their teachers,
like you... deserve to die!

1026
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,440
That's enough.

1027
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,240
These kids have nothing to do
with your problem.

1028
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,240
-Why don't you ever listen to us?
-Why should I listen to you?

1029
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,320
Wasn't it you

1030
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,800
who made me this way?

1031
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,560
No matter what...
I will take these kids with me.

1032
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:44,800
Don't you know...

1033
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:49,240
that all that happened to you
didn't happen the way you thought.

1034
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,520
You misunderstood it this whole time.

1035
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,080
Think hard about the events on that day.

1036
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,560
Are you okay, Miss Pannee?

1037
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:05,040
-We're almost at your room.
-Hurry.

1038
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:06,960
We're here.

1039
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,000
Wait here.

1040
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,400
Thanks, kids. Miss Pannee should be okay.

1041
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:22,920
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

1042
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,680
Let's go, Mr. Sombat.

1043
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,400
Mr. Sombat is dead.

1044
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:34,880
Mr. Saman.

1045
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,680
Remember the day we carried
Miss Pannee to her room?

1046
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,600
Yes.

1047
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,440
After we left,

1048
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,040
I saw Mr. Sombat go back into that room.

1049
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:50,720
It all happened because of your wrath...

1050
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,000
even though you knew the truth...

1051
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,120
that Mr. Saman didn't get you pregnant.

1052
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,960
The one who did, was Mr. Sombat.

1053
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,640
Didn't you kill him already?

1054
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,520
All you want is revenge.

1055
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,760
You thought everyone hurt you...

1056
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:13,800
though they had nothing to do with this.

1057
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:34,280
Lies!

1058
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:37,320
It's not as you say.

1059
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:53,320
<i>Pajera Jariya Honti.</i>

1060
01:27:54,400 --> 01:28:01,360
<i>Kunu Tara Nusa Sakan.</i>

1061
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:08,680
I pay my humble respect

1062
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:13,080
to all my teachers

1063
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:17,520
who gave me an education,

1064
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:22,920
who granted me knowledge,

1065
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,840
taught me ethics

1066
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,800
in this present day.

1067
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,160
<i>Any ghost who thinks he's powerful...</i>

1068
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,400
<i>My friends and I are coming up!</i>

1069
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,880
<i>Ghosts don't exist.</i>

1070
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:41,240
<i>If it's a male ghost,</i>
<i>I'll piss on his damn face.</i>

1071
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:44,120
<i>And for the female one, I'll rape her!</i>

1072
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,640
Pannee.

1073
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,520
You're a good teacher.

1074
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,400
Since the students have made mistakes,

1075
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:56,880
we should teach them
and guide them to the right path.

1076
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,360
Once the students accept their mistakes

1077
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,080
and are ready to apologize...

1078
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,640
we should forgive them.

1079
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,920
Because they call us their teachers.

1080
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,160
Isn't that right, Pannee?

1081
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,000
Pannee.

1082
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,440
Let them go.

1083
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,280
Please, Pannee.

1084
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,120
Let them all go.

1085
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,120
I'm so sorry, teacher.

1086
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:51,560
We're sorry, teacher.

1087
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,440
You can all go now.

1088
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,360
She's letting us go.

1089
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:21,200
I said go!

1090
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,560
Thank you, teacher.

1091
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:21,360
Mark, what are you standing there for?
Hurry up or it might be too late.

1092
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,480
You guys go.

1093
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:25,920
I can't go with you guys anymore.

1094
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,440
Because I'm where I belong.

1095
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,960
You don't belong here.

1096
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,520
This is someone else's home.

1097
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,880
Hurry up, crazy!

1098
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,200
You kids should go.

1099
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:40,680
Mark was right.

1100
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,680
He's been here a long time.

1101
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,040
That's right. I've been here for so long.

1102
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,280
Can you remember?

1103
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,720
When you first came into the building

1104
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:53,840
Hurry up.

1105
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,120
<i>I tried to chase you out of the building,</i>

1106
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,400
<i>but you wouldn't go.</i>

1107
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,800
<i>You weren't afraid of me.</i>

1108
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:13,680
Until today...

1109
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,000
when you arrived here...

1110
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:22,040
I tried to help you,
yet you couldn't leave.

1111
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,360
Guys, follow me. I know the way out.

1112
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:43,920
Do you remember?

1113
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:48,960
That means you're a-a-a... a ghost?

1114
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,120
Yes.

1115
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,320
Everyone...

1116
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,280
I need a favor.

1117
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,400
Go back to the classroom M. 6/5

1118
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,600
and take all of our pictures out...
and burn them.

1119
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:06,440
Yes, sir.

1120
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,760
Hurry up and go, kids, before dawn.

1121
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,160
Go that way.

1122
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,120
Thanks a lot, Mark.

1123
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,560
I'm off.

1124
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:20,840
Let's go.

1125
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:22,880
Goodbye, teachers.

1126
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:28,160
-Let's go.
-Good luck.

1127
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,160
Let's go...

1128
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,160
We're here to fulfill our promise to you.

1129
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,160
May the three of you rest in peace.

1130
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:54,560
Any wrongs that we've done to you,
please forgive us.

1131
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:00,640
I sort of miss Mark.

1132
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:04,840
What the hell, man?
Why would you call him out? He's a ghost!

1133
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,200
Even as a ghost,
he's more generous that you are, Biew.

1134
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:12,320
-He's probably been reborn by now.
-Not yet.

1135
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,120
-Not yet my ass!
-That wasn't me.

1136
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:33,040
-Why are nudging me?
-Your friend's here.

1137
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,200
-What friend?
-Look.

1138
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,040
Mark!

1139
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,760
Honestly, James...

1140
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:48,760
I uber-miss you so much.

1141
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,080
-You know that slang?
-Yes.

1142
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,160
Why the hell did you uber-miss me for?

1143
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,400
Why the hell did you call me here for?

1144
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:57,800
I was just saying it.

1145
01:35:58,920 --> 01:35:59,760
Let go!

1146
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:05,680
I'm gone.

1147
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:07,640
Biew.

1148
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,400
Don't be afraid, Brian.

1149
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:16,240
-Aren't you two afraid of me?
-Yes.

1150
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:20,240
Keep hugging...
and you might get laid tonight.

1151
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,520
Hurry the fuck up and go.

1152
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:25,640
Let's go, Brian.
